A collection of Random Map Scripts:

[Frost and Flood](https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/423682/)
- Seto Rainlands - Shallow currents of water run through the map, bringing opportunities for fish and naval combat, while still allowing your armies to traverse on foot. Take control of the shallow waters through a combination of men, myth and ships.  Play on Regicide Mode for a custom regent, Abe-no-Seimei.  Features a custom King-of-the-Hill mode too.
- Seto Rainlands (Frozen) - A winter version of the above with frozen waters that cannot be built on, this has no options for naval combat or fishing.  Play on Regicide Mode for a custom regent, Abe-no-Seimei.  Features a custom King-of-the-Hill mode too.
- Hokkaido Mountains - This mountainous map features many cliffs that cut through the landscape creating defensive opportunities and a more random layout. Navigate through the many random snow covered cliffs to defeat your opponents.  Play on Regicide mode for a custom Regent, Yuki-onna.  Features a custom King-of-the-Hill mode too.
  
[Deep Mines](https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/422493/)
- Deep Mines: Players find themselves in an abandoned cave mine.  Destroy the forges for bonus gold, and play on Regicide Mode for a custom Regent, the Fire King, Halogi.
  
[Mystic Grove](https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/409187/)
- Mystic Grove: Players find themselves in an enchanted grove surrounded by trees. This map spawns players on the edges of an open grove surrounded by forest. The grove is filled with rolling hills and scattered trees, but is otherwise open with no cliffs, tree lines, or other defensible positions to easily wall.
  
[Erebus Mapset](https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/396102/)
- Nomad (Styx) - Classic Nomad, but on the River Styx there are no fish.
- Erebus Pits - A simple reskin of Mount Olympus.
- Erebus Pits (Nomad) - A reskin of Mount Olympus, but with the gameplay of Nomad, and the map features greater resource randomization.
- Vaults of Erebus - A slight twist on Acropolis, each player spawns with a Plenty Vault on their pleateau, speeding up gameplay slightly and encouraging more defensive gameplay.
